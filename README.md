                                # FOTOMATIC

This particular project is for me to:

1. **Read code that is not my own**
2. **Fix bugs in code that is not my own**
3. **Have a better understanding on the makeings of a responsive website**
4. **Have a better understanding of the power of google dev tools**
5. **Have a better grasp on how to calculate using REMs measurements**

This website first started off as broken code (link to broken code: [HERE](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/fotomatic_broken.zip?_gl=1*1ytomm6*_ga*NzQ4OTI3MDgwLjE2OTYyNDcxNDE.*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTcxMzkzMTkwOS4xMy4xLjE3MTM5MzE5NDQuMjUuMC4w)).

My task was to address and rectify the bugs in the code, ensuring the website's functionality and alignment with the specification sheet. 

Take a look at the spec sheet here:
